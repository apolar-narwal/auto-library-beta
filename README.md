# auto-library-beta
 simple automated library program in python to lend and return books as well as keep a customizable catalogue. this program is optimized to be used by libraries and schools who may not have the resources or faculty to set up a proper library. this program attempts to fix that problem by being easily adaptable. i originally made this for my school, but i'm hoping other's can also benefit from it. there will be a tutorial and explanation of all of its features coming soon. this is a beta, so some things may not work as intended, but for right now all of its core functions are tried and tested.
